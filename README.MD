# MiniQL - JSON files example

An example of MiniQL - the tiny JSON-based query language inspired by GraphQL.

This example shows how to use [miniql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/miniql) and [@miniql/json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@miniql/json) to run queries against a set of JSON files.

Example [Star Wars data is courtesy of Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars/data).
